# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Neutrality Clause

ELEKTO EU is a neutral information tool. Contributors must not:

- Inject political messaging into code, documentation, or UI
- Use the platform to advocate for specific energy policies
- Manipulate data presentation to favor particular conclusions

Data speaks for itself. Our job is to present it accurately and transparently.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project maintainers at joakim@organiq.se.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
